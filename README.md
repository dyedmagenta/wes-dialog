# WesDialog

<p>WesDialog is simple winforms app to copy translation strings from xlsx file to wml file.<p/>
<p>My friends created Wesnoth campagin with all translatable string in polish but as the campaign grew the more and more we felt like to share it with world. We got translator to translate the whole goddamn thing. 
<br>So the only thing left was to replace polish text in scenario files to english ones and move polish into proper translation files</p>
<p>I moved like three of those manually and it was horrible :D</p>
<hr>
<p>I'll write some more as how to use it, configure it etc.</p>
