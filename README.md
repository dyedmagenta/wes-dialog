# WesDialog

<p>WesDialog is simple winforms app to copy translation strings from xlsx file to wml file.<p/>
<p>My friends created Wesnoth campagin with all translatable string in polish but as the campaign grew the more and more we felt like to share it with world. We got translator to translate the whole goddamn thing. 
<br>So the only thing left was to replace polish text in scenario files to english ones and move polish into proper translation files</p>
<p>I moved like three of those manually and it was horrible :D</p>
<hr>
<p>It works and did it's job. Saved a lot of headaches. UI is pretty bad but it does what's it supposed to do, hope you don't need to use this again. If you need to use it chceck main Form1.cs code for shortcuts instead of mindless buttons clicking.</p>
